# TEAMGOALS.md — Cross-Workstream Coordination

> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for tasks and architectural decisions that
> cross workstream boundaries (Core Engine / Cantrip-z / Sheet). Per AGENTS.md,
> each workstream owns its own files; this file is the coordination layer that
> prevents duplication, merge conflicts, and missed dependencies.
>
> **Authority order** (matches ROADMAP.md):
> 1. Code (current repo state)
> 2. Latest uploaded handover (`zHANDOVER-SESSION-*` / `HANDOVER-SESSION-*` / `SHEET-HANDOVER-*`)
> 3. `TEAMGOALS.md` (this file)
> 4. `TASK.md` / `ROADMAP.md`
>
> **Maintenance rule:** Any agent may add a new section to this file when they
> discover a cross-workstream dependency. Use the section template at the bottom.
> Do NOT delete another workstream's section — edit only your own, and only to
> mark status changes (`OPEN` → `IN PROGRESS` → `DONE`).

- _(none pending — Session 53 cleanup removed the stale TG-006 ACK line;
  TG-006 Phase 1/2/3 are DONE per `docs/TG-006-SUMMON-PLAN.md` + verified
  by 21/22 summon/conjure modules present in `src/spells/`. Only Phase 4
  remains open.)_

## CROSS-WORKSTREAM TASKS

These tasks touch files owned by MORE THAN ONE workstream. They cannot be
completed by a single agent without coordination.

### TG-001: Persistent-buff subsystem for multi-effect cantrips (Option B)

- **Status:** DONE — session 46 (13A-13I by Cantrip-z), session 47 (13J-13N by Core Engine: GFB, Lightning Lure, Sapping Sting, Infestation, Gust)
- **Owners:** Cantrip-z (driving) + Core Engine (must review `Combatant` type
  change + `resetBudget` impact)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-15.md` Option B; originally proposed in
  `HandoverOld/zHANDOVER-SESSION-14.md`.
- **Summary:** 5 cantrips have "up to N effects active" caps that v1 ignores:
  Prestidigitation (3), Thaumaturgy (3), Control Flames (3), Mold Earth (2),
  Shape Water (2). Each `applySelfEffect` currently emits a flavor log only.
- **Implementation plan:**
  - Add `activeCantripEffects?: ActiveCantripEffect[]` field to `Combatant`
    (Core Engine owns `src/types/core.ts`).
  - Each `ActiveCantripEffect` tracks: cantrip name, caster ID, effect type,
    expiry turn, target cell/point.
  - The 5 cantrip `applySelfEffect` handlers push to this list (Cantrip-z owns
    `src/spells/<cantrip>.ts`).
  - `resetBudget` in `src/engine/utils.ts` (Core Engine) removes expired
    entries.
- **Risk:** HIGH — touches `Combatant` type, `resetBudget`, and all 5 cantrip
  modules. Both agents must agree on the shape of `ActiveCantripEffect` before
  implementation starts.
- **Coordination protocol:**
  1. Cantrip-z drafts an RFC (3-5 lines) describing the `ActiveCantripEffect`
     shape and posts it as a new section in this file under "RFCs".
  2. Core Engine reviews and approves / proposes changes.
  3. Core Engine adds the field to `Combatant` and the cleanup hook in
     `resetBudget` in a single commit.
  4. Cantrip-z then wires the 5 cantrip handlers in a follow-up commit.

### TG-002: Concentration subsystem (Option C)

- **Status:** DONE (Session 34, z-workstream)
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving) + Cantrip-z (Dancing Lights is the only
  concentration cantrip)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-15.md` Option C; `concentrationSaveDC` already
  exists in `src/engine/utils.ts` (line ~526) but is never called.
- **Summary:** v1 does NOT enforce concentration. Need: damage-taken hook that
  triggers a CON save vs `concentrationSaveDC(damageTaken)`; condition
  disruption (incapacitated, petrified); voluntary ending (free action).
- **Implementation plan:**
  - Core Engine adds a damage-taken hook in `applyDamage` (or
    `applyDamageWithTempHP`) that calls `concentrationSaveDC` and rolls a CON
    save.
  - Core Engine populates `Combatant.concentration` when a spell with
    `concentration: true` is cast (currently `null`).
  - Cantrip-z updates `dancing_lights.ts` to call `startConcentration` (mirror
    Bless / Entangle / Faerie Fire pattern) — currently it does NOT.
- **Risk:** HIGH — Core Engine change affects ALL concentration spells (not
  just cantrips). The Core Engine agent likely already has plans for this.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine announces in its next
  `HANDOVER-SESSION-*.md` that it is picking up TG-002; Cantrip-z then updates
  Dancing Lights to match the new `startConcentration` signature.
- **Resolution (Session 34):** The concentration enforcement pipeline was
  ALREADY implemented in earlier sessions (5 damage sites in `combat.ts`
  calling `rollConcentrationSave` + `removeEffectsFromCaster` + `processFallDamage`),
  but 40 spell metadata flags (`xxxConcentrationEnforcementV1Implemented: false`)
  and 22 corresponding test assertions still marked it as "not implemented".
  Session 34 closed the gap:
  - Verified the end-to-end pipeline via a NEW integration test
    `src/test/concentration_enforcement.test.ts` (34 assertions covering all
    5 damage sites, DC computation, effect cleanup, summon despawn).
  - Fixed a gap at site E (line 4985, moving-zone damage): added the missing
    `processFallDamage(state)` call so Reverse Gravity / Fly / Levitate
    concentration breaks triggered by moving zones (Flaming Sphere, Moonbeam)
    now correctly process fall damage (matches the other 4 sites).
  - Flipped all 40 metadata flags from `false` → `true` in spell files
    (with updated `// TG-002 DONE (Session 34)` comment).
  - Updated all 22 test assertions from `false` → `true` (label text:
    "concentration enforcement NOW implemented (Session 34 TG-002)").
  - All baseline tests still pass (concentration_ai, dispel_magic, mechanics,
    reaction_registry, shield_reaction, absorb_elements, hellish_rebuke,
    counterspell, feather_fall, silvery_barbs, engine, combat, plus all 22
    flipped spells, plus summon/zone tests for reverse_gravity, watery_sphere,
    spirit_guardians, flaming_sphere, moonbeam, spike_growth, summon_beast,
    conjure_animals, witch_bolt, hex, bless).
  - v1 simplifications (War Caster / Resilient feats NOT modelled) are still
    documented in `rollConcentrationSave`'s comment — those would be a
    separate task if ever needed.

### TG-003: AI planner cantrip selection (Option D)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/ai/planner.ts`)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-15.md` Option D.
- **Summary:** Engine routing (`resolveCantripAction` / `resolveCantripAoE` /
  `resolveCantripTouchEffect`) makes cantrips WORK when cast, but the AI doesn't
  know WHEN to cast them. Most cantrips never appear in the AI's plan.
- **Sub-tasks:**
  - Offensive cantrips (Shocking Grasp, Booming Blade, Frostbite, Lightning
    Lure, Green-Flame Blade, Sapping Sting, Infestation, Gust) need a planner
    branch — similar to the existing Guiding Bolt / Dissonant Whispers branch.
  - Utility cantrips (Minor Illusion, Mage Hand, Prestidigitation, Thaumaturgy,
    Message, Control Flames, Mold Earth, Shape Water, Druidcraft, Encode
    Thoughts, Dancing Lights) are out of combat scope — no AI needed.
  - Ability-check cantrips (Guidance, Friends) now have a consumer
    (`rollAbilityCheck`); the planner COULD cast Guidance before a grapple/shove
    attempt. This is a stretch goal — the engine routes grapple/shove via
    `rollGrappleContest` (NOT `rollAbilityCheck`), so wiring would require
    refactoring `rollGrappleContest` to call `rollAbilityCheck`.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — pure planner change, no engine impact.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine owns this. Cantrip-z will NOT touch
  `planner.ts`.

### TG-004: Parser tech debt (Option E)

- **Status:** DONE — session 46: all five fields (`isUndead`, `isConstruct`, `hasMetalArmor`, `spellcastingMod`, `casterLevel`) populated by `monsterToCombatant`. 14/14 bestiary smoke-tests. `isConstruct` added to `Combatant` type.
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/parser/*`)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-15.md` Option E; documented in
  zHANDOVER-3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15.
- **Summary:** Several `Combatant` fields exist but aren't populated by the
  parser:
  - `hasMetalArmor` (Shocking Grasp advantage pre-roll check).
  - `isUndead` (Chill Touch, Healing Word, Cure Wounds — currently a stub).
  - `isConstruct` (does NOT exist yet — needed for Spare the Dying's canon type
    exclusion; currently a v1 simplification flag).
  - `spellcastingMod` (spells use WIS by default — wrong for Wizards (INT),
    Sorcerers/Bards (CHA), Warlocks (CHA)).
  - `casterLevel` (cantrip scaling — currently uses CR as a proxy).
- **Risk:** LOW — additive parser changes; no engine impact.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine owns this. Cantrip-z and Sheet agents
  will consume the fields once they're populated.

### TG-005: Illusion-disbelief Investigation check (Option F)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Cantrip-z (driving — owns `src/spells/minor_illusion.ts`) +
  Core Engine (must review illusion-state + LOS interaction)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-15.md` Option F; built on Session 14's
  `rollAbilityCheck` choke point.
- **Summary:** Now that `rollAbilityCheck` exists, the Investigation check to
  disbelieve a Minor Illusion could use it directly. The harder part is
  illusion-subsystem state (which illusion is in which cell, who's examined it).
- **Implementation plan:**
  - Cantrip-z adds an ` illusions?: IllusionState[]` field on `Battlefield`
    (Core Engine owns `src/types/core.ts`).
  - Minor Illusion's `applySelfEffect` pushes a new illusion into the array
    instead of just emitting a flavor log.
  - A new "examine" action (or a free-action hook in `planTurn`) lets a creature
    spend an action to make an INT (Investigation) check via
    `rollAbilityCheck(examiner, 'int', casterSpellSaveDC)`.
  - On success, the examiner learns the illusion is false; the illusion remains
    for others.
  - LOS: `computeLOS` in `src/engine/los.ts` (Core Engine) may need to treat
    illusions as cover until disbelieved — coordinate.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — touches `minor_illusion.ts`, possibly `computeLOS`, adds
  state to `Battlefield`.
- **Coordination protocol:** Cantrip-z drafts an RFC for the `IllusionState`
  shape; Core Engine reviews.

### TG-006: Summon / Conjure subsystem (Session 19 — bulk-deferred blockers)

- **Status:** Phase 1/2/3 DONE — see `docs/TG-006-SUMMON-PLAN.md`. **Phase 4 OPEN (deferred — 19 bespoke summoning spells each need their own subsystem)**
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/summons.ts` + `src/types/core.ts` summon-state shape) + Cantrip-z (consumes the subsystem in spell modules)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-19.md` (Session 19 bulk-implementation pass — 109 blocker spells identified); Session 21 deep-research pass produced `docs/TG-006-SUMMON-PLAN.md`
- **Summary:** v1 has PARTIAL summon infrastructure (`src/summons/registry.ts` + `spawner.ts` + `mount.ts` — 684 lines, 9 SUMMON_REGISTRY entries, 51/51 passing tests) but NO mid-combat summon insertion, NO concentration-break despawn, and NO spell modules wired to it. **43** in-scope spells (re-categorized from original 38 — `Illusory Script`, `Programmed Illusion`, `Leomund's Secret Chest`, `Drawmij's Instant Summons`, `Conjure Constructs` were missed in Session 19's regex). Of these 43: 12 TCE `Summon *` (LOW risk), 7 PHB `Conjure *` (MEDIUM risk), 3 Find Familiar/Steed (LOW risk) are implementable by Cantrip-z in 4-6 sessions. The remaining 19 (Animate Dead, Create Undead, Magic Jar, Simulacrum, True Polymorph, Glyph of Warding, etc.) need bespoke subsystems — defer to Core Engine.
- **Re-categorization note (Session 21, clarified Session 36):** `Conjure Barrage` (L3) and `Conjure Volley` (L5) are AoE damage spells (not summons) and are NOT blocked by TG-006. They appear only in `src/characters/class_spell_lists.ts` (Ranger list) and have NO spell module yet — if implemented, they would go in `_generic_registry.ts` as damage spells. The earlier "should be moved to the generic registry immediately" note was premature: they were never in the summon blocker list to begin with.
- **Existing infrastructure (do NOT rebuild):** `SUMMON_REGISTRY`, `spawnSummon()`, `issueVerbalCommand()`, mount system (`mount.ts`), `runCombat` reads `bf.pendingCommands` (line 2332). See `docs/TG-006-SUMMON-PLAN.md` §"Existing infrastructure" for full list.
- **Missing infrastructure (must build):** `isSummon`/`summonerId`/`summonSpellName` fields on `Combatant`; `pendingInitiativeInserts` on `Battlefield`; `'summonSpell'` PlannedAction type; `case 'summonSpell':` branch in `combat.ts`; mid-turn initiative-insert hook in `runCombat`; concentration-break despawn extension to `removeEffectsFromCaster`; CR-based creature picker for Conjure spells; 12 TCE stat blocks (hardcoded, not in bestiary).
- **Implementation plan (4 phases):**
  - **Phase 1 (2-3 sessions, LOW risk):** Infrastructure + 12 TCE `Summon *` spells with hardcoded stat blocks. Vertical slice: Summon Beast (L2) + Summon Fey (L3) + Summon Undead (L3) in Session 22.
  - **Phase 2 (1-2 sessions, MEDIUM risk):** 7 PHB `Conjure *` spells with bestiary CR-based picker. (Conjure Barrage / Conjure Volley are NOT in scope — they are AoE damage spells, not summons, and have no spell module yet.)
  - **Phase 3 (1 session, LOW risk):** Find Familiar (L1), Find Steed (L2), Find Greater Steed (L4) — reuses existing `spawnSummon`.
  - **Phase 4 (DEFER):** 19 remaining spells (Animate Dead, Create Undead, Magic Jar, Simulacrum, True Polymorph, Shapechange, Glyph of Warding, Symbol, Programmed Illusion, Illusory Script, Demiplane, Leomund's Secret Chest, Drawmij's Instant Summons, Planar Ally, Planar Binding, Gate, Infernal Calling, Create Magen, Clone) — each needs bespoke subsystem. Split into individual TG entries under TG-011 or new TG-012..TG-030.
- **Risk:** LOW for Phase 1/3, MEDIUM for Phase 2, HIGH for Phase 4 (deferred). All type/engine changes are additive (optional fields, new case branch, new helper function) — no breakage to existing spells.
- **Coordination protocol:** Post an RFC in TEAMGOALS.md before touching `combat.ts` `runCombat` loop — give Core Engine 1 session to object. See `docs/TG-006-SUMMON-PLAN.md` §"Cross-Workstream Touchpoints" for the full file-by-file checklist.
- **Blocked spells (43 — original 38 + 5 missed in Session 19):**
  - **Level 1 (2):** Find Familiar (PHB), Illusory Script (PHB) [missed in S19].
  - **Level 2 (2):** Find Steed (PHB), Summon Beast (TCE).
  - **Level 3 (7):** Animate Dead (PHB), Conjure Animals (PHB), Conjure Constructs (FRHoF) [missed in S19], Glyph of Warding (PHB), Summon Fey (TCE), Summon Lesser Demons (XGE), Summon Shadowspawn (TCE), Summon Undead (TCE). (Conjure Barrage is an AoE damage spell — NOT a summon, NOT blocked by TG-006.)
  - **Level 4 (7):** Conjure Minor Elementals (PHB), Conjure Woodland Beings (PHB), Find Greater Steed (XGE), Leomund's Secret Chest (PHB) [missed in S19], Summon Aberration (TCE), Summon Construct (TCE), Summon Elemental (TCE), Summon Greater Demon (XGE).
  - **Level 5 (5):** Conjure Elemental (PHB), Infernal Calling (XGE), Planar Binding (PHB), Summon Celestial (TCE), Summon Draconic Spirit (FTD). (Conjure Volley is an AoE damage spell — NOT a summon, NOT blocked by TG-006.)
  - **Level 6 (5):** Conjure Fey (PHB), Create Undead (PHB), Drawmij's Instant Summons (PHB), Magic Jar (PHB), Planar Ally (PHB), Programmed Illusion (PHB) [missed in S19], Summon Fiend (TCE).
  - **Level 7 (4):** Conjure Celestial (PHB), Create Magen (IDRotF), Simulacrum (PHB), Symbol (PHB).
  - **Level 8 (2):** Clone (PHB), Demiplane (PHB).
  - **Level 9 (4):** Gate (PHB), Shapechange (PHB), True Polymorph (PHB).

### TG-007: Wall subsystem (Session 19 — bulk-deferred blockers)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/los.ts` + `Battlefield.obstacles`) + Cantrip-z (consumes in spell modules)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-19.md` (Session 19 bulk-implementation pass — 12 wall spells identified)
- **Summary:** v1 has no wall subsystem. Walls require a "shape on the grid" model (line / cylinder / sphere / cube), block-LOS / block-movement flags, and persistent damage riders. 12 in-scope wall spells from levels 3–9 are blocked on this subsystem.
- **Implementation plan:**
  - Extend `Obstacle` interface in `src/types/core.ts` with `spellName?: string`, `damageType?: DamageType`, `damageDice?: { count, sides }`, `saveDC?: number`, `saveAbility?: AbilityScore`.
  - Core Engine adds a start-of-turn wall-damage hook in `runCombat` (parallel to `damage_zone`).
  - Cantrip-z wires each Wall spell to push an `Obstacle` with the appropriate shape.
- **Risk:** HIGH — walls interact with LOS, cover, and movement simultaneously.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine designs the shape API (line vs cylinder vs cube); Cantrip-z wires spell modules.
- **Blocked spells (12):**
  - **Level 3 (3):** Wall of Sand (XGE), Wall of Water (XGE), Wind Wall (PHB).
  - **Level 4 (1):** Wall of Fire (PHB).
  - **Level 5 (3):** Wall of Force (PHB), Wall of Light (XGE), Wall of Stone (PHB).
  - **Level 6 (2):** Wall of Ice (PHB), Wall of Thorns (PHB).
  - **Level 9 (1):** Prismatic Wall (PHB).

### TG-008: Reaction spell subsystem (Session 19 — bulk-deferred blockers)

- **Status:** DONE (Session 33 + Session 34, z-workstream)
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/combat.ts` reaction window) + Cantrip-z (consumes in spell modules)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-19.md` (Session 19 bulk-implementation pass — 5 reaction spells identified)
- **Summary:** v1 has NO reaction subsystem beyond pre-set reactions in TurnPlan. Several classic spells are reaction-cast (triggered by an incoming attack / spell / fall). 5 in-scope spells blocked.
- **Implementation plan:**
  - Core Engine adds a `triggerReaction(actor, event)` hook in `resolveAttack` / `castSpell` paths.
  - Reaction spells register a trigger condition (incoming-attack / incoming-spell / falling).
  - When the trigger fires, the engine invokes the spell's `execute` if a slot is available.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — additive hook; no engine disruption.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine announces the trigger API; Cantrip-z wires spell modules.
- **Resolution (Session 33):** Implemented the full reaction subsystem:
  - `ReactionTrigger` discriminated union + `ReactionOutcome` type in `src/types/core.ts`
  - `ReactionSpellDescriptor` interface + `REACTION_SPELLS` registry in `src/spells/_reaction_registry.ts`
  - `triggerReactions(state, reactor, trigger)` helper in `src/engine/combat.ts` — iterates the registry, checks preconditions (reaction budget, slot, spell known, alive/conscious), fires the first matching spell
  - 4 trigger points wired in `resolveAttack` (incoming_attack_hit for Shield/Silvery Barbs, incoming_damage at 3 sites for Absorb Elements/Hellish Rebuke), `executePlannedAction` (incoming_spell for Counterspell), and `processFallDamage` (falling for Feather Fall)
  - Absorb Elements rider consumption in the standard attack damage branch
  - Cleanup wired in `resetBudget` (utils.ts) for Absorb Elements resistance
  - 6 reaction spells implemented: Shield (reworked to trigger-aware), Absorb Elements, Hellish Rebuke, Silvery Barbs, Counterspell, Feather Fall
  - 285 new test assertions across 7 test files (reaction_registry, shield_reaction, absorb_elements, hellish_rebuke, counterspell, feather_fall, silvery_barbs)
  - All baseline tests still pass (cure_wounds, healing_spells, healing_word, engine, ai, resources, scenario, combat, shield_simple, shield_of_faith, invisibility, thunderous_smite, booming_blade, green_flame_blade, conjure_fey, dispel_magic, etc.)
- **Resolution (Session 34):** Closed the 7th in-scope spell:
  - Implemented Protection from Energy (PHB p.266) as a regular concentration
    buff spell (L3 abjuration, touch, 10 min concentration, resistance to one
    damage type: acid/cold/fire/lightning/thunder). NOT a true reaction — the
    Session 19 categorization was a stretch.
  - New file `src/spells/protection_from_energy.ts` (~225 lines): metadata,
    `pickTarget`, `pickDamageType`, `shouldCast`, `execute`,
    `executeWithTarget`, `cleanup`.
  - Wired into the generic spell registry (`_generic_registry.ts`) so the AI
    planner can auto-cast it.
  - Added `_undoEffect` case for 'Protection from Energy' in
    `src/engine/spell_effects.ts` — when concentration breaks, removes the
    resistance from `target.resistances` (reads `payload.damageType` to know
    which type to remove; only the type we added is removed — innate
    resistance to other types is preserved).
  - New test `src/test/protection_from_energy.test.ts` (52 assertions):
    metadata, pickTarget priority, pickDamageType AI, shouldCast
    preconditions, execute mechanics, damage halving, concentration-break
    cleanup, generic-registry end-to-end dispatch.
  - All baseline tests still pass.
- **Blocked spells (5):**
  - **Level 1 (3):** Absorb Elements (XGE) ✅, Shield (PHB) ✅, Feather Fall (PHB) ✅.
  - **Level 1 (1):** Hellish Rebuke (XGE) ✅.
  - **Level 1 (1):** Silvery Barbs (SCC) ✅.
  - **Level 3 (1):** Counterspell (PHB) ✅.
  - **Level 3 (1):** Protection from Energy (PHB) ✅ (Session 34 — implemented
    as a regular concentration buff spell, NOT a reaction; the Session 19
    categorization as a reaction was a stretch).

### TG-009: Antimagic / Dispel subsystem (Session 19 — bulk-deferred blockers)

- **Status:** PARTIAL — Dispel Magic (L3) ✅ DONE (`src/spells/dispel_magic.ts`, PHB p.233). Dispel Evil and Good (L5) + Antimagic Field (L8) remain OPEN.
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/spell_effects.ts` `removeEffectsFromCaster`) + Cantrip-z (consumes in spell modules)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-19.md` (Session 19 bulk-implementation pass — 3 antimagic spells identified)
- **Summary:** v1 has no spell-effect-suppression subsystem beyond Dispel Magic. Dispel Evil and Good and Antimagic Field need to enumerate active effects on a target and remove them (Antimagic Field: area suppress ALL magic; Dispel Evil and Good: target specific effect categories).
- **Implementation plan:**
  - Core Engine adds a `dispelEffects(target, levelThreshold)` function in `spell_effects.ts`.
  - Antimagic Field requires an "is in antimagic field?" check at every spell-cast site.
  - Cantrip-z wires Dispel Evil and Good / Antimagic Field spell modules.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — Dispel Evil and Good is straightforward; Antimagic Field is invasive (every cast site).
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine designs the dispel API.
- **Blocked spells (2 remaining):**
  - **Level 5 (1):** Dispel Evil and Good (PHB).
  - **Level 8 (1):** Antimagic Field (PHB).

### TG-010: computeLOS / vision-blocking subsystem (Session 19 — bulk-deferred blockers)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/los.ts` `computeLOS`) + Cantrip-z (consumes in spell modules)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-19.md` (Session 19 bulk-implementation pass — 18 vision-blocking spells identified)
- **Summary:** v1's `computeLOS` does not query any "is the target obscured by magical darkness / fog / invisibility?" state. Darkness, Fog Cloud, Greater Invisibility, Arcane Eye, Clairvoyance, Scrying, True Seeing, etc. all need this extension. Forward-compat flags already exist for See Invisibility / Darkvision — extending `computeLOS` to consume them is the canonical implementation path.
- **Implementation plan:**
  - Core Engine adds an `obscuredCells?: Set<string>` field on `Battlefield` (cell-key = `${x},${y},${z}`).
  - Darkness / Fog Cloud push obscured cells with `blockVision: true` ( Darkness: blocks even darkvision).
  - Greater Invisibility adds the `invisible` condition to the target (existing condition).
  - `computeLOS` checks obscured cells and returns appropriate LOS / cover results.
  - Divination spells (Arcane Eye, Clairvoyance, Scrying) extend `computeLOS` to allow remote sight.
- **Risk:** HIGH — `computeLOS` is on every attack path; changes here ripple across the engine.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine designs the obscured-cells API; Cantrip-z wires spell modules.
- **Blocked spells (18):**
  - **Level 2 (4):** Augury, Darkness, Locate Animals or Plants, Locate Object (all PHB).
  - **Level 3 (2):** Clairvoyance (PHB), Tongues (PHB).
  - **Level 4 (4):** Arcane Eye (PHB), Divination (PHB), Greater Invisibility (PHB), Locate Creature (PHB).
  - **Level 5 (4):** Commune, Contact Other Plane, Dream, Legend Lore, Scrying (all PHB).
  - **Level 6 (2):** Find the Path (PHB), True Seeing (PHB).
  - **Level 7 (1):** Dream of the Blue Veil (TCE).
  - **Level 8 (1):** Telepathy (PHB).

### TG-011: Complex mechanics subsystem (Session 19 — bulk-deferred blockers)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/combat.ts` movement + state) + Cantrip-z (consumes in spell modules)
- **Source:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-19.md` (Session 19 bulk-implementation pass — 28 complex-mechanic spells identified)
- **Summary:** A grab-bag of spells with mechanics v1 cannot model: teleportation (Dimension Door, Thunder Step, Far Step, Teleport, Teleportation Circle, Word of Recall, Wind Walk, Etherealness, Plane Shift, Banishment, Rope Trick), resurrection (Revivify, Raise Dead, Reincarnate, Resurrection, True Resurrection, Gentle Repose), wards (Magic Circle, Forbiddance, Hallow, Unhallow, Temple of the Gods, Guards and Wards, Mighty Fortress, Contingency, Mind Blank), feast / utility (Heroes' Feast, Sending, Water Breathing, Water Walk, Awaken, Wish, Maze, Imprisonment, Astral Projection).
- **Implementation plan:**
  - Teleportation: extend `executeMove` to allow non-adjacent jumps (gated by spell module).
  - Resurrection: extend `runCombat` to allow revival from `isDead` / `isUnconscious`.
  - Wards: extend `Battlefield` with a `wards?: WardState[]` field.
  - Wish / Maze / Imprisonment / Astral Projection: each needs bespoke subsystem.
- **Risk:** HIGH — many bespoke subsystems.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine designs each subsystem on a per-spell basis; Cantrip-z wires modules.
- **Blocked spells (28):**
  - **Level 2 (2):** Gentle Repose, Rope Trick.
  - **Level 3 (5):** Magic Circle, Revivify, Sending, Thunder Step, Water Breathing, Water Walk.
  - **Level 4 (2):** Banishment, Dimension Door.
  - **Level 5 (5):** Awaken, Hallow, Raise Dead, Reincarnate, Teleportation Circle.
  - **Level 6 (5):** Contingency, Forbiddance, Guards and Wards, Heroes' Feast, Wind Walk, Word of Recall.
  - **Level 7 (4):** Etherealness, Plane Shift, Resurrection, Teleport, Temple of the Gods.

  - **Level 9 (4):** Astral Projection, Imprisonment, True Resurrection, Wish.

### TG-012: Sheet clearance on TG-001..TG-011 + RFC-stall fallback (Sheet-proposed)

- **Status:** OPEN (protocol portion — clearance portion below is DONE)
- **Owners:** Sheet (driving this entry) — protocol applies to all three workstreams
- **Source:** SHEET-HANDOVER-31 follow-up session; reviewed all of TG-001 through
  TG-011 and `docs/TG-006-SUMMON-PLAN.md` against Sheet-owned files
  (`src/characters/*`, `src/character_router.ts`, `docs/characters.html`).
- **Clearance (DONE):** Zero overlap found. Specifically checked TG-006 Phase 3
  (Find Familiar / Find Steed / Find Greater Steed) for a persistent
  companion/familiar field on the character sheet — confirmed these spawn as
  combat-only `Combatant` entries via the existing `spawnSummon` pattern, so
  no character-sheet schema change is needed. No other TG entry references
  character data, spell-list data, or any Sheet-owned file. **Sheet has no
  open prerequisite blocking any TG item today.** If a future TG item needs
  persistent character-sheet data (e.g. a permanent familiar slot), tag Sheet
  as a reviewer in that entry and this agent will pick it up next session.
- **Stall risk observed:** `zHANDOVER-SESSION-21.md` (commit `b53b622`) has
  Cantrip-z completing research + a 4-phase plan for TG-006 and explicitly
  waiting on a Core Engine RFC review before touching `combat.ts`/`runCombat`.
  Core Engine's current `TASK.md` (Tier-1 PHB 1st-level spells: Shield,
  Guiding Bolt, Healing Word) does not yet reference TG-006, so the RFC has
  no guaranteed read-by date.
- **Proposed fallback protocol (non-binding until an owning agent adopts it,
  per the RFC rule above):**
  1. A driving agent posting an RFC that needs another workstream's sign-off
     adds one line under a new `## PENDING REVIEW` log at the top of this
     file: `TG-### awaiting <workstream> review since session <N> — see <doc>`.
  2. Every agent checks that log at session start (before its own TASK.md)
     and either actions it or replies `ACKNOWLEDGED — reviewing, ETA <N>`.
  3. If 2 full sessions pass with no acknowledgment, the driving agent may
     proceed on LOW-risk, purely-additive sub-phases only (new optional
     fields, new files in directories it already owns) — it still may NOT
     touch another workstream's shared hot-path files (e.g. `runCombat`,
     `computeLOS`) without explicit sign-off, timeout or not.
  4. On completion, the driving agent deletes its `PENDING REVIEW` line and
     flips the TG entry to DONE.
- **Risk:** LOW — process-only change, no code/type impact.
- **Coordination protocol:** This entry is itself the RFC. Core Engine or
  Cantrip-z may amend/reject in their own next commit; otherwise treat as a
  recommendation, not a rule, per the RFCs section below.

## RFCs (Proposed shapes for cross-workstream fields)

> Any agent may propose a new RFC. Use the template at the bottom of this file.
> RFCs are PROPOSED — they become binding only when an owning agent implements
> them and removes the RFC section.

(none yet)

### TG-013: Move `rollDiceString` from `booming_blade.ts` to `utils.ts`

- **Status:** DONE — session 46 (Core Engine: added to `utils.ts`, updated `combat.ts` import) + session 51 (Cantrip-z: cleaned up re-export in `booming_blade.ts:209` — verified `export { rollDiceString } from '../engine/utils'`).
- **Owners:** Cantrip-z (driving — owns `src/spells/booming_blade.ts`) + Core Engine (must update `src/engine/combat.ts` import)
- **Source:** Core Engine peer review, Session 45
- **Summary:** `rollDiceString` (parses `"NdM"` strings and rolls them) is exported from `src/spells/booming_blade.ts` and imported directly by `src/engine/combat.ts` (line 57) for the Booming Blade detonation in `executeMove`. A spell module must not be a utility dependency of the engine. `utils.ts` already owns `rollDie` and `rollDice`; this function belongs there too.
- **Implementation plan:**
  - Cantrip-z: add `export function rollDiceString(expr: string): number` to `src/engine/utils.ts` (identical body to the current one in `booming_blade.ts`).
  - Cantrip-z: remove the export from `booming_blade.ts`, or replace it with `export { rollDiceString } from '../engine/utils'` if `booming_blade.test.ts` imports it directly from the spell module.
  - Core Engine (or Cantrip-z if Core Engine approves): update `combat.ts` line 57 to `import { ..., rollDiceString } from './utils'` and remove the alias `rollBoomingBladeDice`.
  - Run `booming_blade.test.ts` and `combat.test.ts` to confirm no regressions.
- **Risk:** LOW — pure refactor, no behaviour change. The function body is identical; only the import path changes.
- **Coordination protocol:** Cantrip-z may make the `utils.ts` addition and `booming_blade.ts` change unilaterally. The `combat.ts` import line is Core Engine territory — Cantrip-z should either make it in the same PR and note the change in their handover, or flag it here for Core Engine to pick up.

### TG-014: Fix "melee spell attack" label in Booming Blade and Green-Flame Blade comments

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Cantrip-z (driving — owns both spell modules)
- **Source:** Core Engine peer review, Session 45
- **Summary:** TCE is unambiguous — both spells say "make a melee attack with it… the target suffers the **weapon attack's** normal effects." The current module headers and inline comments incorrectly label the primary hit as a "melee spell attack (attackType='spell')". No behaviour change is needed (the engine routes these through the weapons array, so `hitBonus` is already sourced from the weapon, not `spellAttackBonus`), but the incorrect label risks misleading a future implementer into routing them through the SPELL_DB spell-attack path.
- **Implementation plan:**
  - `src/spells/booming_blade.ts` line 31: change "melee spell attack (attackType='spell')" → "melee weapon attack".
  - `src/spells/green_flame_blade.ts` line 36: same change.
  - `src/spells/green_flame_blade.ts` line 263: update "after the melee spell" → "after the melee weapon attack".
- **Risk:** LOW — comment-only change, zero behaviour impact.
- **Coordination protocol:** Cantrip-z owns both files; no Core Engine sign-off needed.

### TG-015: Wire Elemental Affinity (Draconic Sorcerer 6) into weapon-rider spells

- **Status:** OPEN — Cantrip-z can wire spell-module side; Core Engine owns
  the `combat.ts` damage-roll sites where the bonus fire/lightning dice are
  added to weapon attacks.
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/combat.ts` damage-roll
  branch around `_nextHitRider`, `_flameBladeActive`, `weapon_enchant`) +
  Cantrip-z (reviewer — owns the spell modules whose metadata describes the
  rider)
- **Source:** zHANDOVER-SESSION-50 Next-Session Priority #29-follow-up-5c-4
- **Summary:** Elemental Affinity (PHB p.102) adds CHA mod to "one damage roll
  of [the] spell" when the spell deals damage of the caster's draconic ancestry
  type. For spells whose damage roll happens inside `combat.ts` (the engine's
  `resolveAttack` damage branch), EA is NOT currently applied. Per SAC v2.7
  (2019) clarification: bonus damage dealt BY a spell — even when triggered by
  a weapon attack — counts as "the spell's damage" for EA. Therefore EA should
  apply to the bonus fire/lightning dice added by:
  - **Flame Blade** (PHB p.242, 2014): +3d6 fire rider on melee weapon attacks
    while `_flameBladeActive` is true (combat.ts line ~2007)
  - **Lightning Arrow** (PHB p.255, 2014): +4d8 lightning rider on next ranged
    weapon attack via `_nextHitRider` (combat.ts line ~1886)
  - **Elemental Weapon** (PHB p.234, 2014): +1d4 elemental rider on every weapon
    attack via `weapon_enchant` effect (combat.ts line ~1988)
  - **Searing Smite** (PHB p.274, 2014): +1d6 fire rider on next weapon hit via
    `_nextHitRider` (combat.ts line ~1886)
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Core Engine: at each of the 3 damage-roll sites (Flame Blade rider,
     `_nextHitRider` consume, `weapon_enchant` dice), call
     `elementalAffinityBonus(attacker, rider.damageType)` and add it to the
     bonus damage. The bonus is flat (NOT doubled on crit — PHB p.196).
  2. Core Engine: add a regression test in `combat.test.ts` covering a Draconic
     Sorcerer 6 casting Flame Blade + making a melee weapon attack — the +3d6
     fire bonus should include +CHA mod when ancestry = fire.
- **Risk:** LOW — additive bonus in 3 well-isolated damage-roll sites; no
  engine-loop restructuring.
- **Coordination protocol:** Cantrip-z has confirmed (this TG entry) that the
  spell-module side already exposes the correct `damageType` on every rider
  payload; Core Engine can implement unilaterally. Add a single commit, then
  note in the next HANDOVER-SESSION-XX.md.
- **Reverse-published-order note:** All 4 affected spells are PHB 2014 — no
  newer-source variants exist for this mechanic.

### TG-016: Transfer sorcery points to Combatant (29-follow-up-5e)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/characters/builder.ts`
  `buildRawResources()` AND `src/parser/pc.ts` `buildResources()`) + Sheet
  (reviewer — owns `src/characters/types.ts` `CharacterResources` shape, which
  already has `sorceryPoints?`)
- **Source:** zHANDOVER-SESSION-50 Next-Session Priority #29-follow-up-5e
- **Summary:** `CharacterResources.sorceryPoints?` exists (types.ts line 221)
  and is populated by the leveler when a Sorcerer reaches level 2. However,
  `buildRawResources()` in `builder.ts` (line ~218) does NOT pass `sorceryPoints`
  through to the Combatant — it stops at `arcaneRecovery` and never reaches the
  Sorcerer's resource. The Combatant therefore starts combat with 0 sorcery
  points, which means:
  - `Draconic Presence` (Sorcerer 18, 5 SP cost) uses a v1 simplification of
    "1/combat" instead of the canon 5-SP cost.
  - `Flexible Casting` (Sorcerer 2, convert SP↔slots) cannot be implemented.
  - Any future Metamagic options cannot be costed in SP.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Core Engine: add `if (res.sorceryPoints) out.sorceryPoints = { max: res.sorceryPoints.max, remaining: res.sorceryPoints.max };` to `buildRawResources` (mirrors `actionSurge` / `bardicInspiration` pattern).
  2. Core Engine: ensure `buildResources` in `pc.ts` reads the `sorceryPoints` field and populates `Combatant.resources.sorceryPoints = { max, remaining }`.
  3. Core Engine: in `draconic_presence.ts` (or wherever the action fires), replace the v1 "1/combat" gate with a `sorceryPoints.remaining >= 5` check + decrement.
  4. Sheet: add a "Sorcery Points" row to the resources panel in `docs/characters.html` for Sorcerers (mirror the existing `actionSurge` row pattern).
- **Risk:** LOW — additive resource transfer; existing tests should be
  unaffected (no test asserts that sorcery points are absent).
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine implements steps 1-3 unilaterally;
  Sheet picks up step 4 in its next session.

### TG-017: Wire Open Hand Monk Open Hand Technique + Quivering Palm (29-follow-up-4c)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/combat.ts` damage branch
  + `src/characters/builder.ts` `buildRawResources`) + Sheet (reviewer —
  owns `src/characters/types.ts` `CharacterResources.ki?` which already exists)
- **Source:** zHANDOVER-SESSION-50 Next-Session Priority #29-follow-up-4c
- **Summary:** Open Hand Monk has 5 subclass features; 2 are wired (Wholeness
  of Body, Diamond Soul). The remaining 3 need ki tracking which is the same
  gap as TG-016 — `CharacterResources.ki?` exists but is NOT transferred to
  the Combatant via `buildRawResources`/`buildResources` (identical pattern).
  Once ki is available on the Combatant:
  - **Open Hand Technique** (Monk 3, PHB p.79): once per turn when you hit
    with Flurry of Blows, choose one: prone (no save), push 15 ft (STR save),
    or can't take reactions until next turn (STR save).
  - **Tranquility** (Monk 11, PHB p.80): at end of long rest, gain Sanctuary
    (WIS save DC = monk spell save DC) — broken by attack or by being the
    attacker.
  - **Quivering Palm** (Monk 17, PHB p.80): touch attack, 3 ki, target makes
    a CON save vs monk spell save DC; on fail, drops to 0 HP; on success,
    takes 10d10 necrotic.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Core Engine: add `ki` to `buildRawResources` (mirror TG-016 step 1).
  2. Core Engine: add `ki` consumption to the existing Flurry of Blows logic
     in `combat.ts` (currently Flurry of Blows is implemented but ki cost is
     not deducted — verify before implementing Open Hand Technique).
  3. Core Engine: implement Open Hand Technique as a per-turn rider that
     fires once when Flurry of Blows hits. Plumb a new `OpenHandTechniqueChoice`
     field on TurnPlan (or default to "prone" for the AI).
  4. Core Engine: implement Quivering Palm as a new `'quiveringPalm'` action
     type in `executePlannedAction` (mirrors `draconicPresence` pattern).
  5. Sheet: add "Ki Points" row to resources panel for Monks in
     `docs/characters.html`.
  6. Tranquility is DEFERRED — long-rest-triggered Sanctuary is outside the
     combat-only scope of v1.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — Flurry of Blows plumbing already exists; the Open Hand
  Technique rider needs to fire between the two Flurry attacks, which requires
  careful sequencing.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine drives steps 1-4. Sheet picks up
  step 5 in its next session.

### TG-018: Wire Land Druid fey/elemental charm/frighten immunity (29-follow-up-3d)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/combat.ts`
  `applySpellEffect` + `rollSave` paths)
- **Source:** zHANDOVER-SESSION-50 Next-Session Priority #29-follow-up-3d
- **Summary:** Nature's Ward (PHB p.68, Druid Circle of the Land 6) grants:
  (1) poison immunity + disease immunity (WIRED in Session 47), and (2)
  "you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey". The second part
  requires source-creature-type tracking on conditions: when a charm/frighten
  effect is applied, the engine must record which creature (and its type)
  applied it. Then on the Land Druid, if the source creature is fey or
  elemental, the condition is suppressed.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Core Engine: extend `ActiveEffect` (or `conditions` set entries) with an
     optional `sourceCreatureType?: string` field, populated by
     `applySpellEffect` when the caster's `creatureType` is known.
  2. Core Engine: add a `creatureType?` field to `Combatant` if not present
     (populated by parser for monsters; PC race for characters).
  3. Core Engine: in `applySpellEffect` for `condition_apply` effects of
     `charmed`/`frightened`, check if the target has Nature's Ward + the
     source creature is fey/elemental; if so, skip application + emit log.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — touches `Combatant` type + `applySpellEffect` hot path.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine drives. Add RFC to TEAMGOALS.md
  RFCs section if the `ActiveEffect` shape needs review.

### TG-019: Per-class unarmored-AC hook for shield equip (Sheet-41c follow-up)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Sheet (driving — owns `src/character_router.ts` `computeArmorAC`
  + `docs/characters.html`)
- **Source:** SHEET-HANDOVER-41.md "DISCOVERIES RELEVANT TO NEXT TASK"
- **Summary:** SHEET-41c added AC auto-update on armor/shield equip. The
  unarmored formula uses `10 + DEX mod` as the base. If the character has a
  class feature that changes their unarmored AC (Barbarian: `10 + DEX mod +
  CON mod`; Monk: `10 + DEX mod + WIS mod`), the formula base should be
  different. Currently equipping/unequipping a shield on a Barbarian or Monk
  uses the wrong base — undercounting their AC.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Sheet: in `computeArmorAC`, detect class features `Unarmored Defense`
     (Barbarian) and `Unarmored Defense` (Monk) on the character sheet. Use
     the appropriate formula: `10 + DEX mod + CON mod` for Barbarian,
     `10 + DEX mod + WIS mod` for Monk.
  2. Sheet: extend `computeArmorAC` to accept a "shield" parameter; if the
     equipped item is a shield, add +2 to whatever the unarmored or armored
     formula returns.
  3. Sheet: add tests for Barbarian + Monk shield toggle.
- **Risk:** LOW — purely additive Sheet-side change; no engine impact.
- **Coordination protocol:** Sheet owns all of this; no cross-workstream
  sign-off needed.

### TG-020: Model diseases for Lesser Restoration (20-follow-up-2)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/combat.ts` +
  `src/types/core.ts`)
- **Source:** zHANDOVER-SESSION-50 Next-Session Priority #20-follow-up-2
- **Summary:** `Lesser Restoration` (PHB p.255) ends one disease OR one
  condition (blinded/deafened/paralyzed/poisoned/stunned) on a target. v1
  models the condition-end but NOT disease-end because diseases are not
  tracked. Several spells/monsters inflict diseases (e.g., Contagion,
  Mummy Lord's Rotting Fist). Without disease tracking, those mechanics are
  silent in v1.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Core Engine: add `diseases?: DiseaseState[]` field to `Combatant`.
  2. Core Engine: `applySpellEffect` for `contagion` (and similar) pushes a
     `DiseaseState` with `name`, `incubationOver`, `effect`.
  3. Core Engine: `lesser_restoration.ts` clears one disease from the list
     (in addition to its existing condition-end).
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — diseases are an entirely new state category; need to
  decide if diseases have combat-time effects (most don't — they're long-rest
  afflictions).
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine drives. May DEFER if combat-time
  disease effects are deemed out-of-scope for v1.

### TG-021: Devil's Sight invocation (continuation of Task #16)

- **Status:** OPEN — DEFERRED since Session 16. Requires LOS engine changes.
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/los.ts`) + Cantrip-z
  (reviewer — owns `src/spells/_invocations.ts`)
- **Source:** zHANDOVER-SESSION-50 Next-Session Priority #22; originally
  zHANDOVER-SESSION-16.
- **Summary:** Devil's Sight (PHB p.110, Warlock Invocation) lets the
  warlock see normally in darkness (including magical darkness) within 120
  ft. v1's `computeLOS` does not query "is the target in magical darkness?"
  state. Wiring requires:
  1. A `magicalDarknessCells?: Set<string>` field on `Battlefield` (TG-010
     adjacent — Darkness / Hunger of Hadar push to this set).
  2. `computeLOS` checks the field; if both attacker and target are in
     magical darkness AND the attacker has Devil's Sight, treat as normal
     LOS. If the attacker has Devil's Sight but the target is in normal
     darkness, no change (Devil's Sight doesn't grant darkvision — only the
     ability to see through magical darkness).
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — touches `computeLOS` which is on every attack path.
- **Coordination protocol:** Coordinate with TG-010 (vision-blocking
  subsystem) since both touch the same `Battlefield` field.

### TG-022: Additional Fighting Style for Champion 10 (29-follow-up-6)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Sheet (driving — owns `src/characters/leveler.ts` +
  `docs/characters.html`) + Core Engine (reviewer — owns
  `src/characters/builder.ts` if Fighting Style needs to flow to Combatant)
- **Source:** zHANDOVER-SESSION-50 Next-Session Priority #29-follow-up-6
- **Summary:** Champion (Fighter subclass) gets a second Fighting Style at
  level 10 (PHB p.72). v1 has no character-build choice for this — the
  leveler picks the first Fighting Style at Fighter 1 but doesn't expose a
  second choice at Fighter 10. Currently the second style is silently
  absent.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Sheet: add a `secondFightingStyle?` field to `CharacterSheet` (in
     `subclassChoices` or a new top-level field).
  2. Sheet: in `leveler.ts`, when applying level 10 of Champion, prompt
     for a second Fighting Style choice (UI flow).
  3. Sheet: `docs/characters.html` — add a dropdown in the level-up modal
     when level 10 of Champion is reached.
  4. Core Engine: in `builder.ts`, propagate `secondFightingStyle` to the
     Combatant's `classFeatures` array (so e.g. Defense +1 AC from second
     style applies in combat).
- **Risk:** LOW — Sheet-side UI flow; small builder.ts extension.
- **Coordination protocol:** Sheet drives steps 1-3; Core Engine picks up
  step 4 in its next session.

### TG-023: Additional Wild Magic Surge options (27-follow-up-3)

- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/combat.ts` surge
  table)
- **Source:** zHANDOVER-SESSION-50 Next-Session Priority #27-follow-up-3
- **Summary:** Wild Magic Surge (PHB p.103, Sorcerer Wild Magic 1) currently
  fires only when the main action was a spell cast. The v1 surge table
  covers ~1/3 of the PHB surge effects. The remaining effects (e.g.,
  "cast Fireball centered on self", "summon 2d6 pixies") need a "Surge for
  different spells when main was Attack" branch — i.e., the surge can fire
  on non-spell actions too if the Sorcerer cast a spell earlier in the
  round (e.g., via Quicken Spell metamagic).
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Core Engine: extend the surge trigger to fire on ANY action that
     expends a spell slot (not just spell-cast main actions).
  2. Core Engine: add the remaining PHB surge effects to the table.
  3. Core Engine: add a regression test in `combat.test.ts` covering the
     extended trigger.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — extending the surge trigger may cause cascading
  flakiness (surges are random); de-flake with seeded RNG if needed.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine drives.

### Tier-A items (LOW risk, ship first)

#### TG-024: Sorcery Points + Ki transfer to Combatant (combines TG-016 + TG-017 step 1-2)

- **Status:** OPEN — proposed Session 53
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/parser/pc.ts` `buildResources` + `src/types/core.ts` `PlayerResources`) + Sheet (reviewer — owns `src/characters/builder.ts` `buildRawResources`)
- **Source:** Session 53 audit; combines TG-016 + TG-017 step 1-2 into one commit (kinematic mirror of the `actionSurge` pattern at `builder.ts:226`).
- **Summary:** `CharacterResources` already has `ki?` and `sorceryPoints?` (populated by `leveler.ts:923, 930-931`) but `buildRawResources` (Sheet) and `buildResources` (Core) both SKIP these fields. Result: a Monk or Sorcerer PC has zero ki/sorcery points in combat. This blocks TG-017 Quivering Palm, TG-015 Draconic Presence 5-SP cost, and any ki-based subclass feature.
- **Implementation plan (single commit):**
  1. Sheet (`builder.ts:218-238`): in `buildRawResources`, after the `actionSurge` branch, add: `if (res.sorceryPoints) out.sorceryPoints = { max: res.sorceryPoints.max, current: res.sorceryPoints.current ?? res.sorceryPoints.max };` and `if (res.ki) out.ki = { max: res.ki.max, current: res.ki.current ?? res.ki.max };`
  2. Core (`pc.ts:208-320`): in `buildResources`, mirror the same two branches.
  3. Core (`types/core.ts`): ensure `PlayerResources` has `sorceryPoints?: { max: number; current: number }` and `ki?: { max: number; current: number }` (both already optional).
  4. Test: extend `resources.test.ts` — spawn a Monk 5 + assert `ki.current === 5`; spawn a Sorcerer 5 + assert `sorceryPoints.current === 5`.
- **Risk:** LOW — additive parser + sheet changes; no engine impact.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine drives; Sheet reviews the `builder.ts` change.
- **Reverse published order note:** Both PHB 2014 sources. Combined because the fix is structurally identical (one resource field each).

#### TG-025: Per-class unarmored-AC hook (Sheet-41c follow-up) — promotes TG-019

- **Status:** OPEN — proposed Session 53 (promotes TG-019 from research to actionable)
- **Owners:** Sheet (driving — owns `src/character_router.ts` `computeArmorAC`)
- **Source:** Session 53 audit; SHEET-HANDOVER-41 Discovery.
- **Summary:** `computeArmorAC` in `character_router.ts:123-165` uses `const unarmoredBase = 10 + dexMod;` unconditionally. A Barbarian or Monk with a shield toggled on gets the wrong AC (should be `10 + DEX + CON` for Barbarian's Unarmored Defense, `10 + DEX + WIS` for Monk's).
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. In `computeArmorAC`, detect `Unarmored Defense` class feature from `sheet.classLevels` (Barbarian 1 OR Monk 1).
  2. If Barbarian: `unarmoredBase = 10 + dexMod + conMod`.
  3. If Monk: `unarmoredBase = 10 + dexMod + wisMod`.
  4. Test (`src/test/character_router.test.ts` or new `unarmored_defense.test.ts`): Barbarian 1 with DEX 14 CON 16 + shield → AC 17 (10+2+3+2). Monk 1 with DEX 14 WIS 16 + shield → AC 17.
- **Risk:** LOW — Sheet-side only; no engine impact.
- **Coordination protocol:** Sheet drives unilaterally.

#### TG-026: Resources panel UI — Ki Points + Sorcery Points rows (Sheet-side completion of TG-016 step 4 + TG-017 step 5)

- **Status:** OPEN — proposed Session 53
- **Owners:** Sheet (driving — owns `docs/characters.html`)
- **Source:** Session 53 audit; depends on TG-024 landing first.
- **Summary:** `docs/characters.html` resources panel already has rows for `actionSurge`, `bardicInspiration`, `rage`, etc. Add two new rows: `ki` (visible for Monk 1+) and `sorceryPoints` (visible for Sorcerer 1+). Mirror the `actionSurge` row's HTML pattern (label + current/max + increment/decrement buttons + reset-on-rest hook).
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Add HTML rows in `docs/characters.html` (search for `actionSurge` to find the pattern).
  2. Add JS handlers in the same file (mirror `actionSurge` handlers).
  3. Add server endpoints if missing: `POST /api/character/:id/spend-ki` and `POST /api/character/:id/spend-sorcery-point` (mirror existing `spend-action-surge`).
  4. Test: extend `src/test/server.test.ts` — call endpoints + assert resources decrement.
- **Risk:** LOW — UI + REST endpoints only.
- **Coordination protocol:** Sheet drives; depends on TG-024.

#### TG-027: Wire Elemental Affinity into weapon-rider damage sites in `combat.ts` (Core Engine side of TG-015)

- **Status:** OPEN — proposed Session 53 (promotes the Core Engine half of TG-015)
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/combat.ts`)
- **Source:** Session 53 audit; TG-015 spell-module side already done (Sessions 47-51).
- **Summary:** Three damage-roll sites in `combat.ts` apply weapon-rider bonus damage (Flame Blade rider ~line 2007, `_nextHitRider` consume ~line 1886 for Lightning Arrow + Searing Smite, `weapon_enchant` dice ~line 1988 for Elemental Weapon). None of them call `elementalAffinityBonus(attacker, rider.damageType)`, so a Draconic Sorcerer 6 with red ancestry doesn't get +CHA to fire-rider damage from these sources.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. At each of the 3 sites, after computing the rider's bonus damage, call `elementalAffinityBonus(attacker, rider.damageType)` (already exported from `utils.ts`) and add it. Bonus is flat (NOT doubled on crit — PHB p.196).
  2. Test: extend `combat.test.ts` — spawn a Sorcerer 6 red ancestry with Flame Blade cast + assert rider damage includes +CHA.
- **Risk:** LOW — additive damage bonus; no engine restructuring.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine drives unilaterally.

#### TG-028: Fix "melee spell attack" labels in Booming Blade + Green-Flame Blade (TG-014)

- **Status:** OPEN — proposed Session 53 (promotes TG-014)
- **Owners:** Cantrip-z (driving — owns `src/spells/booming_blade.ts` + `green_flame_blade.ts`)
- **Source:** TG-014.
- **Summary:** Comment-only fix. Both modules label their primary hit as "melee spell attack (attackType='spell')" when TCE clarifies it's a "melee weapon attack". Risk of misleading future implementers.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. `src/spells/booming_blade.ts` line 31: change "melee spell attack (attackType='spell')" → "melee weapon attack".
  2. `src/spells/green_flame_blade.ts` line 36: same change.
  3. `src/spells/green_flame_blade.ts` line 263: update "after the melee spell" → "after the melee weapon attack".
- **Risk:** ZERO — comment-only.
- **Coordination protocol:** Cantrip-z owns both files.

### Tier-B items (MEDIUM risk, ship after Tier A)

#### TG-029: Champion 10 second Fighting Style (promotes TG-022)

- **Status:** OPEN — proposed Session 53 (promotes TG-022)
- **Owners:** Sheet (driving — owns `src/characters/leveler.ts:382` + `docs/characters.html`) + Core Engine (reviewer — propagates `classFeatures` to `Combatant`)
- **Source:** Session 53 audit; TG-022.
- **Summary:** `leveler.ts:382` flags Champion 10's "Additional Fighting Style" as `flag-only (second Fighting Style choice not modelled)`. Sheet needs to expose a UI choice at Champion 10 + Core needs to propagate the choice into `Combatant.classFeatures` so combat mechanics honor it.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Sheet: add `secondFightingStyle?: string` to `CharacterSheet` (in `subclassChoices` or top-level).
  2. Sheet: in `leveler.ts:382`, replace the flag with a `subclassChoices.secondFightingStyle = ['Archery','Defense','Dueling','Great Weapon Fighting','Protection','Two-Weapon Fighting']` (PHB p.72 list).
  3. Sheet: add UI dropdown in `docs/characters.html` (mirror the existing Fighting Style dropdown at Fighter 1).
  4. Sheet (`builder.ts`): propagate `secondFightingStyle` into `classFeatures` array.
  5. Core: no change needed — `classFeatures` already drives existing Fighting Style mechanics (the second one is purely defensive/stacking; only Defense stacks as +1 AC).
  6. Test: extend `subclass_features.test.ts` — Champion 10 with second Defense style gets +1 AC.
- **Risk:** LOW (Sheet-side) — Defense is the only stackable Fighting Style (PHB p.72: "you can't take a Fighting Style option more than once"); the second Defense is a rare but RAW-legal edge case the engine should honor.
- **Coordination protocol:** Sheet drives steps 1-4; Core Engine reviews step 5.

#### TG-030: Quivering Palm action type (TG-017 step 4) — blocked on TG-024

- **Status:** OPEN — proposed Session 53 (promotes TG-017 step 4)
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/combat.ts` `executePlannedAction`)
- **Source:** TG-017 step 4.
- **Summary:** Quivering Palm (Open Hand Monk 17) needs a new `'quiveringPalm'` action type in `executePlannedAction`, mirroring the `'draconicPresence'` pattern from Session 49. Touch attack + CON save + instakill on failed save / 10d8 necrotic on success. Costs 3 ki.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Add `'quiveringPalm'` case to `executePlannedAction` in `combat.ts`.
  2. Add `quiveringPalmTargets?: Set<string>` to `Combatant` (track which targets have been "touched" and are vulnerable to the follow-up 10d8 trigger).
  3. Planner (`planner.ts`): add a branch that picks the highest-HP target for the touch (then triggers 10d8 on a later turn if the target is still alive).
  4. Test (`src/test/quivering_palm.test.ts`): Monk 17 vs 60-HP target — touch succeeds, follow-up triggers, CON save fails → target dies. CON save succeeds → 10d8 necrotic.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — touch + CON save + instakill has many edge cases.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine drives; blocked on TG-024 (ki transfer).

#### TG-031: Open Hand Technique Flurry rider (TG-017 step 3) — blocked on TG-024

- **Status:** OPEN — proposed Session 53 (promotes TG-017 step 3)
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/combat.ts` + `src/ai/planner.ts`)
- **Source:** TG-017 step 3.
- **Summary:** Open Hand Technique (Monk 3) fires per Flurry-of-Blows hit: choose to push 15 ft / knock prone / disable reaction until next turn. The rider needs to fire BETWEEN the two Flurry attacks (per PHB p.79 "immediately after you hit"). v1 simplification: rider fires once per Flurry (after the second hit), not per hit.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Add `openHandTechniqueChoice?: 'prone' | 'push' | 'disabler'` to `TurnPlan` (default 'prone' for AI).
  2. In `combat.ts` Flurry-of-Blows case, after the second attack, apply the chosen effect.
  3. Planner: branch for `openHandTechniqueChoice` selection based on target state (knock prone if not prone; push if adjacent to pit; disable reaction if caster).
  4. Test (`src/test/open_hand_technique.test.ts`): Monk 3 with Flurry of Blows hits target twice → target is prone (default choice). Manually-set choice 'push' → target moved 15 ft.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — per-turn rider sequencing is fiddly.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine drives; blocked on TG-024.

#### TG-032: Land Druid fey/elemental charm/frighten immunity (promotes TG-018)

- **Status:** OPEN — proposed Session 53 (promotes TG-018)
- **Owners:** Core Engine (driving — owns `src/engine/spell_effects.ts` + `src/engine/utils.ts` `addCondition`)
- **Source:** Session 53 audit; TG-018.
- **Summary:** Nature's Ward (Land Druid 10) grants immunity to charmed and frightened by fey and elementals. v1's `addCondition` doesn't track source-creature-type, so it can't apply this restriction. Needs a `sourceCreatureType?: string` field on `ActiveEffect` and a check in `addCondition`.
- **Implementation plan:**
  1. Add `sourceCreatureType?: string` to `ActiveEffect` (in `core.ts`).
  2. Add `creatureType?: string` to `Combatant` (parser already populates `creatureType` for monsters in `fivetools.ts`).
  3. In `addCondition`, when applying `charmed` or `frightened`, check if the target has Nature's Ward class feature AND the source effect's `sourceCreatureType` is `fey` or `elemental` → skip application.
  4. Test (`src/test/natures_ward.test.ts` extends existing): Land Druid 10 vs Fey caster's Charm Person → spell lands but condition is rejected.
- **Risk:** MEDIUM — touches `addCondition` hot path.
- **Coordination protocol:** Core Engine drives.

### Tier-C items (HIGH risk or split-required, defer)

> TG-001 (RFC + ongoing-effects subsystem), TG-007 (Wall subsystem),
> TG-010 (vision-blocking) + TG-021 (Devil's Sight), TG-011 (28 complex
> mechanics spells), TG-006 Phase 4 (19 bespoke summoning spells) all
> remain deferred per their existing entries. Each is HIGH-risk and
> requires an RFC before touching `combat.ts`. New agents: pick Tier A
> first, then Tier B; leave Tier C for dedicated RFC sessions.
